By Dale Hahn, Wayne Payne and Ellen Lucas
*Focus on Health* offers an exciting and practical approach to the teaching of the traditional content areas of personal health. Its two key themes - the six dimensions of health and the five developmental tasks - help students apply the text's content to their own lives, by improving their decision-making skills.

The strength of the *Focus on Health*narrative includes its appeal to both traditional and non-traditional students, particularly the special attention it pays to students over age 25 who have returned to college.

In addition, among its many health assessment activities, *Focus on Health* includes one of the most comprehensive health assessments found in any personal health textbook - a great tool for establishing a health baseline for students.

The companion Online Learning Center (website) offers a wealth of pedagogical and assessment features, including quizzes, Internet activities, downloadable MP3s, and more.
